## **Welcome to the Opentrons Community!**

Opentrons makes low-cost, open-source robots for biologists that help them carry out experiments in their labs. We encourage discovery, creation, contribution, and sharing of automated scientific workflows.

To learn more, visit our [website](http://opentrons.com) or contact us at community@opentrons.com.

We're part of the 2019 [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/round-7/participants/participants---cohort-c/) cohort, and we'd love to bring more people into our network! If you're interested in the intersection of open science, robots, and community-driven biology, this is the place for you.

Make sure to read and adhere to our [Participation Guidelines](./participation_guidelines). Also, check out our first [issue](https://github.com/Opentrons/Hack-A-Tron/issues/1) in this repository to learn about ways you can get involved!
