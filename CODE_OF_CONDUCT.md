<!--- HACK-A-TRON PARTICIPATION GUIDELINES --->
# Participation Guidelines

Opentrons, as part of the Mozilla Global Sprint for Internet Health, respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behavior as participants, mentors, experts, staff, volunteers, and anyone else involved.
We have largely borrowed these guidelines directly from Mozilla's community code of conduct, with some modification.

## How we treat each other

* Be respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.
* Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.
* Be inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.
* Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs.
* Be open to learning from others.
* Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

## Our Take on Inclusion and Diversity

Opentrons welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you; we welcome you!

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

## Raising Issues

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact us at community@opentrons.com.

We reserve the right to refuse admission and/or remove anyone violating these policies.
